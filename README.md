# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

    The purpose of the analysis is to show how different city types can influence the amount of fare collected by the drivers. Also, to provide a direction of how to invest more efficiently on the business, with the higher demand/profit available. 
    
## Results:

    The results show that the rural area has the higher average fare per rider among the sample. However, that is because of the low count of drivers in rural areas. Looking the total amount of fares by weekly we can clearly see that urban areas are the most profit city type in the sample. 

## Summary:

    With the analysis we are able to conclude that there is a lack of workforce willing to work on rural areas, probably because of the lower population located there. Also, urban areas are where we have the highest amount of fare collected, which should be the focus of the investments in the future.
